# E-Commerce-Customer-Behavior-Analysis

## Overview: 
In this project, we explore a dataset containing information about e-commerce customer behavior. The dataset includes features such as account length, location code, user ID, session details, transaction history, and churn status. Our goal is to apply advanced machine learning models to predict customer churn, segment customers based on their behavior, and uncover patterns in their interactions.

### Notebooks & Repository layout 

0. dataset: E-Commerce _Customer_Behavior.csv

1. Neural Networks
Feedforward Neural Networks: Utilizes a feedforward neural network to predict customer churn based on various features.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Explores using CNNs to analyze image-related features, if applicable.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Investigates the use of RNNs to capture sequential patterns in customer behavior.

2. Unsupervised Learning Models
Clustering: Implements K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their behavior.

3. Dimensionality Reduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces the dimensionality of the dataset using PCA to visualize high-dimensional data and improve model performance.
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): Applies t-SNE to visualize the dataset in lower dimensions, preserving local structure.
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP): Explores UMAP as an alternative dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing complex datasets.

### Data
The dataset (data/E-Commerce _Customer_Behavior.csv) contains anonymized information about e-commerce customer behavior. It includes various features such as session details, transaction history, and churn status. Refer to the dataset documentation for more details about each feature.
